# Project--Grades-Linear-Regression
### Linear Regression Project to predict final using the other predictor variables
#### Refer file grades.csv 

##### The school principal wants to build a predictive model for predicting final for his consumption. As a principal he is very keen to have good scores by his students. He has given this data file to you with a request to suggest an appropriate model.You are required to build at least 4 models with different sets of predictors (independent variables). Selection of sets of predictor/s is upon you. Different sets of predictors can be a single variable or more than one variable. However, selection of predictor/s should be based on some logic. For example, for predicting final score of students, roll number cannot be a logical predictor. You will analyze all 4 models based on following points and recommend the best model to the Principal.
